            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hi there! I’m Rehan, a 10th-grade student with an insatiable curiosity for the world of computers. My journey began when I got my first laptop in 7th grade—what started as simple exploration soon turned into a full-blown passion for software, operating systems, and everything in between.  <br><br>

<b>How It All Started</b><br>
I remember spending countless hours tinkering with my laptop, diving into the depths of operating systems, virtual machines, and even a bit of website development (HTML, CSS, and a touch of Java). But my biggest "oops-turned-achievement" moment? Accidentally deleting Windows while trying to install *Phoenix OS* for Free Fire! Panic set in, but instead of giving up, I turned to YouTube, learned how to reinstall an OS, and successfully booted Windows 11 Lite from a USB drive my brother gave me. That was the day I installed my first operating system—and I haven’t looked back since.  <br><br>

<b>From Kali Linux to Web Development</b><br>
My curiosity led me to ethical hacking, and I took my first steps by installing Kali Linux. While hacking fascinated me, I soon realized my true interest lay in *creating* rather than breaking. That’s when I circled back to web development, where I could build, design, and bring ideas to life. <br><br> 

<b>What Drives Me</b><br>
I love the thrill of solving problems and the satisfaction of making things work. Whether it’s troubleshooting an OS, coding a webpage, or learning a new tech skill, I’m always up for a challenge. Right now, I’m sharpening my web development skills and exploring new technologies—because in the digital world, there’s always something exciting to learn.  

When I’m not glued to my laptop, you’ll find me brainstorming new projects or (occasionally) remembering to take a break!
